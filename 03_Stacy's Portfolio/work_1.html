			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>Bridge Me is a career counseling platform that connects people for sharing their issues and know-hows about career development especially related to working overseas. </br></br> 
			Many people all over the world dream of working overseas such as Silicon Valley. However, working overseas is not always as easy as just flying to someplace and finding a job like you would back in your home country. </br> 
			There are visa issues, work permits, and language barriers to think about. Unless you have someone who got a job overseas, it is not easy to find information outside of the internet. Moreover, the information related to this is extremely scattered around the Internet, and there are many inaccuracies. </br> 
			In response to this problem, I designed a mobile app to enable people to share their career-related concerns and get practical advice from experts working in the related fields.</p>

		<div class="problem">
			<h4>Problem</h4>
			<p><span style="font-weight: 600;">First,</span> Most of the people live with their own career concerns. </br>Such as, Where can I move a job?  How can I handle the salary negotiation? If I want to change my career, what am I supposed to do first? and so on... </br></br> 
				<span style="font-weight: 600;">Second,</span> There are many career information website and mentoring service. </br>But, It is not easy to get the suitable information for an individual situation. </br></br> <span style="font-weight: 600;">Third,</span> Many of similar services provide just one-time information, also inadequate to maintain ongoing communication and relationship.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="research">
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>We did secondary research including benchmarks, as well as primary research including the online survey, and individual interviews. </br> 
The purpose was gathering market status and define the real problems from the many of different services. 
Also, to gain a deeper understanding of people who have career concern. </br></br>

<span style="font-weight: 600;">1. Benchmarks </span> </br>
Compared and analyzed 8 services including people matching services (i.e.Tinder) as well as providing career information platforms. We researched about 'What information they offer?', pros & cons, main process of service, etc. You can check the details on here. </br></br>

<span style="font-weight: 600;">2. Online Survey </span></br>
We have conducted online surveys to investigate the market status and discomfort of related services. We've collected a lot of answers quantitatively about 'What is the main concerns about career development?', 'How people solved these concerns?', 'How satisfied they are?', 'Which information would be most needed?', etc.
Created a 15-question questionnaire and over 107 people answered it. Detailed results are here. </br></br>

<span style="font-weight: 600;">3. Individual Interview </span></br>
With 18 people who are graduate students and beginner workers, we had quick interviews to know the needs about career advice or mentoring service. Here is the summary note. Also, we have conducted long interviews with 4 peoples who are having an expertise in their industry with many work-experience in abroad. Here is the notes of expert interview. </br></br>
